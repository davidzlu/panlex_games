# panlex_games
This repo contains games that use the PanLex database in some way. Currently there are three games:
    1) Password (2-player)
    2) Password (1-player)
    3) Telephone

## Password (2-player)
The objective of the password game is to guess a hidden word from several clues. The 2-player version assigns one person to be the knower and another to be the guesser. The knower submits a password for the guesser to guess, and provides clues for the password. The guesser tries to guess the password. Players can select any language in PanLex to play in. The database provides translations of expressions between players.

## Password (1-player)
The objective of the single-player password game is the same as the two-player version. However, clues are provided differently. Clues are all synonyms of a randomly selected password. Additionally, with each incorrect guess, a letter of the password is revealed.

## Telephone
The objective of the telephone game is to translate from a source expression to a target expression. Translations go from the current expression to one in any other language, as long as the expression is in PanLex.
